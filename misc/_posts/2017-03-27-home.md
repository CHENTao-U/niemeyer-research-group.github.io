We study **fluid dynamics** phenomena using computer simulations, particularly fluid flows involving chemical reactions such as **combustion**. Our work extends from **chemical kinetic reaction models** for transportation fuels to computationally expensive, direct numerical simulations of **turbulent combustion**.

Our research focuses on numerical methods to reduce the computational expense of accurately simulating combustion and engineering fluid flows, as well as the actual physical phenomena like turbulence-chemistry interactions and smoldering combustion.
