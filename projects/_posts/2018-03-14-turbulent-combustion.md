summary: >
  Most practical combustion phenomena are turbulent, but turbulent flames pose
  a challenging modeling problem due to the complex interactions between fluid flow,
  chemical kinetics, and thermodynamics. We are both studying the turbulence-chemistry
  interactions that occur in the combustion of practical fuels, and also developing
  better modeling techniques and best practices.
