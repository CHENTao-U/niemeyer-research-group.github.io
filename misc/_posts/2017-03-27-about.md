# Design and Implementation

Although I created a [personal website](http://kyleniemeyer.com) years ago using [Jekyll] (originally as a grad student), I recently came across the research group websites of [Holly Bik] and [D. Allan Drummond] and fell in love with their simple but effective designs. (These were both in turn inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s site.) I greatly appreciate that these groups all shared their site source; in particular, my group site is directly based on the [Drummond Lab template].

This site's source code is freely available on [GitHub] under the MIT license, and deployed using [GitHub Pages].
