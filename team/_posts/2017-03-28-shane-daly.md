Shane graduated with his MS in Mechanical Engineering in September 2015, and was co-advised with [Prof. Christopher Hagen](http://osucascades.edu/energy-systems-lab/dr-christopher-hagen). His research focused on correlating infrared spectroscopic measurements of fuels with their performance in advanced low-temperature combustion engines. Shane is currently a PhD candidate in the [Energy Systems Lab].
