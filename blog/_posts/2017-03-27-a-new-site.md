Our new group website is up and running! Previously, I tried to use my [personal site](http://kyleniemeyer.com) as the group site, but decided to split these so that more focus could be placed on the other group members. (Considering they do the majority of the work, this seems appropriate)

This site is inspired by---in fact, directly forked from---the research group websites of [Holly Bik] and [D. Allan Drummond], so all original credit goes to them.

This space will be evolving rapidly in the coming days and weeks, so stay tuned!
