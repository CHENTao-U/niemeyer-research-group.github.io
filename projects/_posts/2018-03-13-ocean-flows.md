summary: >
  Turbulent mixing and biogeochemical processes in the ocean can interact when
  occurring at similar time scales; for example, carbonate formation occurs at similar
  time scales as small-scale turbulence in the upper ocean, while submesoscale eddies
  evolve over the same time scales as plankton blooms. This project seeks to
  understand how these processes interact with each other, which has implications
  for global biogeochemical cycles. It involves accurate large-eddy simulations of
  upper-ocean turbulence and detailed biogeochemical kinetic models.
